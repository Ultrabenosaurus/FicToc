###### *Automatic Table of Contents for your writing project!* ######

FicToc aims to make it easy for you to keep your amateur (or professional) writing project! Inspired by my frustration at WordPress-using translation projects and amateur fiction writers not updating project ToCs in a timely fashion, I decided to make a plugin that handles most of it for you.

## Development ##

I'm using [VCCW](http://vccw.cc/) to work on this, which is a great [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) box designed specifically for WordPress development.

If you already use Vagrant with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), just `vagrant up` and hit `fictoc.dev` in your browser of choice (you might need to add `vccw.dev 192.168.33.10` to your `hosts` file, especially on Windows) to get a look at the plugin running in its current state.

If you don't have Vagrant, chances are you probably don't even know what it is. Go hit up [their website](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and see if it's something you're comfortable playing with, and if so follow the [VCCW instructions](http://vccw.cc/#h2-1) to get their environment set up. If you don't think it's something you're okay to play with then you'll need to figure out on your own how to integrate my code with your development environment.
